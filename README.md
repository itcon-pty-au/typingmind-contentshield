## How It Works

The extension monitors chat input in real-time, scanning for patterns defined in your active rules. When sensitive information is detected:

1. The chat input field is highlighted with a colored border
2. A detailed tooltip appears showing:
   - Which rules were triggered
   - The exact text that matched
   - The location (line and character position) of each match

This visual feedback helps you identify and avoid sharing sensitive information in your conversations.

## Privacy and Security

- All processing is done entirely client-side
- No data is sent to any server
- Your configurations are stored only in your browser's local storage
- The extension has no external dependencies
