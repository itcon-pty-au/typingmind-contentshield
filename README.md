## How It Works

The extension monitors chat input in real-time, scanning for patterns defined in your active rules. When sensitive information is detected:

1. The chat input field is highlighted with a glowing border effect that:
   - Uses multiple layers of box shadows for depth
   - Includes an inner glow effect
   - Animates smoothly on appearance/disappearance
2. A detailed tooltip appears showing:
   - Which rules were triggered
   - The detected sensitive text
   - The location (line and character position) of each match
3. Clicking on a position indicator will:
   - Focus the input field
   - Select the relevant text
   - Scroll smoothly to bring the text into view

This visual feedback helps you identify sensitive information before sending your messages.

## Privacy and Security

- All processing is done entirely client-side
- No data is sent to any server
- Your configurations are stored only in your browser's local storage
- The extension has no external dependencies
