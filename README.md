## How It Works

The extension monitors chat input in real-time, scanning for patterns defined in your active rules. When sensitive information is detected:

1. The chat input field is highlighted with a colored border:
   - Red border: Sensitive information detected (unmasked)
   - Green border: Sensitive information detected and masked
2. A detailed tooltip appears showing:
   - Which rules were triggered
   - The original sensitive text
   - The masked version of the text
   - The location (line and character position) of each match
3. If masking is enabled for the matched rule:
   - The sensitive text is automatically replaced with masked characters
   - The masking preserves the specified format and length settings
   - The original text remains visible in the warning tooltip for verification

This visual feedback helps you identify sensitive information and verify that it's being properly masked before sending your messages.

## Privacy and Security

- All processing is done entirely client-side
- No data is sent to any server
