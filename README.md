## Using this extension

1. Load `https://itcon-pty-au.github.io/typingmind-contentshield/contentshield.js` into Menu > Preferences > Extension in TypingMind.
2. A new "Shield" button will appear in the TypingMind sidebar.
3. Click on the Shield button to access the configuration panel where you can:
   - Enable/disable ContentShield
   - Manage content rules (with rule count display)
   - Customize appearance settings
   - Import/export rule configurations
4. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut (default: Shift+Alt+P) to open the configuration panel.

## Default Rules

The extension comes with six predefined rules to detect common types of sensitive information:

1. **Credit Card Number** (Regular Expression)

   - Detects sequences of 13-16 digits with optional spaces or dashes
   - Pattern: `\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b`

2. **Email Address** (Regular Expression)

   - Detects standard email address formats
   - Pattern: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b`

3. **SSN** (Regular Expression)

   - Detects Social Security Number patterns (xxx-xx-xxxx format)
   - Pattern: `\b(?:\d{3}[-.]?){2}\d{4}\b`
   - Supports optional dots or dashes as separators

4. **Secret Variable** (Variable Assignment)

   - Detects assignments to sensitive variables
   - Pattern: `(password|secret|key|token)\s*=\s*["']([^"']+)["']`
   - Matches variable names containing: password, secret, key, token

5. **Confidential Reference** (String Match)

   - Simple case-insensitive match for "confidential"
   - Non-regex, exact text match

6. **Secret Reference** (String Match)
   - Simple case-insensitive match for "secret"
   - Non-regex, exact text match

## Managing Rules

### Adding a new rule

1. Open the ContentShield configuration panel
2. Click "Add Rule"
3. Provide the following details:
   - Rule Name - A descriptive name for the rule
   - Rule Type - Choose between:
     - "String Match" - Simple text matching with case sensitivity option
     - "Regular Expression" - Advanced pattern matching
     - "Variable Assignment" - Detect sensitive data in variable assignments
   - Pattern - The text pattern to detect
   - Case Sensitive (for String Match only) - Toggle if the match should be case-sensitive

### Editing a rule

1. Click the edit (pencil) icon next to any rule
2. Modify the rule details in the editor
3. Click "Save" to apply changes

### Deleting rules

- Individual rule: Click the delete (trash) icon next to any rule
- All rules: Click "Delete All" button and confirm the action
  - A confirmation dialog will suggest exporting rules as backup
  - The rules counter will update automatically

### Enabling/disabling rules

Toggle the checkbox next to any rule to enable or disable it without deleting it.

## Customizing Appearance

1. Open the ContentShield configuration panel
2. Click "Show" in the Appearance section
3. Adjust:
   - Highlight Color - The color used for the glowing border effect
   - Border Width - Choose from Thin (1px) to Very Thick (4px)
   - Warning Header Color - The background color for the warning header
   - Menu & Keyboard Controls:
     - Hide extension from menu - Option to remove the ContentShield button from the sidebar
     - Keyboard Shortcut - Set a custom keyboard combination to open the panel (required if extension is hidden from menu)
   - Menu Icon Placement - Choose where to position the ContentShield button in the sidebar
4. Click "Save Styles" to apply changes

## Importing and Exporting Rules

### Exporting rules

1. Click the "Export" button in the ContentShield configuration panel
2. A TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file containing your rules will be downloaded
3. The TSV format includes: id, type, pattern, name, active status, description, and case sensitivity

### Importing rules

1. Click the "Import" button in the ContentShield configuration panel
2. Select a TSV file containing rules (<a href="https://github.com/itcon-pty-au/typingmind-contentshield/blob/main/typingmind-contentshield-rules.tsv">Here is a comprehensive rule set for importing </a>)
3. The system will:
   - Validate all rules (especially regex patterns)
   - Skip any invalid rules
   - Add new rules that don't conflict with existing ones
   - Show a summary of added and skipped rules

## How It Works

The extension monitors chat input in real-time, scanning for patterns defined in your active rules. When sensitive information is detected:

1. The chat input field is highlighted with a glowing border effect that:
   - Uses multiple layers of box shadows for depth
   - Includes an inner glow effect
   - Animates smoothly on appearance/disappearance
2. A detailed tooltip appears showing:
   - Which rules were triggered
   - The detected sensitive text
   - The location (line and character position) of each match
3. Clicking on a position indicator will:
   - Focus the input field
   - Select the relevant text
   - Scroll smoothly to bring the text into view

This visual feedback helps you identify sensitive information before sending your messages.

## Privacy and Security

- All processing is done entirely client-side
- No data is sent to any server
- Your configurations are stored only in your browser's local storage
- The extension has no external dependencies
